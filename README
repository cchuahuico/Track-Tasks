Track Work

Description:
5 mini todo lists each with corresponding countdown timers. After the countdown, it plays a wav file in the same directory as the script.
The wav file that came with this package is from: http://www.wavsource.com/

Requirements:
  - Python 2.5+
  - wxPython: http://www.wxpython.org/

Download: http://github.com/downloads/cchuahuico/Track-Tasks/Track%20Tasks.zip

Usage:
  - Run track.py, set the timer, then start it. 
  - If you wish to change the .wav file, simply replace it with another one in the same directory as track.py. 
     *Note track.py won't accept wav audio encoded in mp3. An easy fix would be to run: ffmpeg -i in.wav out.wav
