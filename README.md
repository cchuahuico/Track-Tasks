Track Work
----------
5 mini todo lists each with corresponding countdown timers. After the countdown, it plays a wav file in the same directory as the script. The wav file that came with this package is from: http://www.wavsource.com/

Requirements:
-------------
  - Python 2.5+
  - wxPython: http://www.wxpython.org/

Usage:
------
  - Run track.py, set the timer, then start it. 
  - There must be a wav file beside track.py for it to work.

WAV:
----
If you wish to change the wav file, simply replace it with another one in the same directory as track.py. 

**Note:** track.py won't accept wav audio encoded in mp3. An easy fix if you have ffmpeg installed would be to run: `ffmpeg -i in.wav out.wav`
